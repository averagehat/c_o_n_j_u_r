# c_o_n_j_u_r
an alternative openframeworks backend for my video sampler 
(r_e_c_u_r)[https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r]

this is a work in progress, currently working towards feature parity with the existing omxplayer backend, and then experimenting with adding glsl shader playback/interaction (digital video synthesis) both standalone and as video processing/effects
